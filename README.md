## Project Description

Bl3nd is a dapp in which you can mix 2 of your NFTs (from any collection) and they will become a Super Rare new one.

The base NFTs will be locked, supporting your newly minted NFT until you decide not to.
At that moment, you can burn the new one and get back the originals.
The new NFT can be transferred and sold in marketplaces, as any NFT around!

Creativity is the limit for Bl3ndâ€™s use cases!

_Bl3nd surged from a team of contributors to the Wake Up DAO in the search of giving more utility to the NFTs._
_We think that interoperability is key to the success of web3 and this is a step to make it closer._
